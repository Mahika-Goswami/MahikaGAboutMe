                <P style="width: 700px;"style="float: right;">Forbes 30 under 30. CMO in a massive tech company. CEO of my own company by my 50’s. These are my career goals! Yes, they are ambitious and quite dramatic. But these are my dreams. Living in highline New York, catering to the market - or manipulating the market myself? I want to create a splash in business myself, whether that means heading marketing at a company or creating my own product. To achieve this goal, I believe it all starts with education. Post-high school, I want to major in economics and business. My dream colleges include (but are not limited to!) Stanford, UPenn, UChicago, and UC Berkeley Haas. Before my own ventures as an entrepreneur, I hope to intern at a company in my 20s to achieve experience and training in a real work setting. This is my career choice because I’ve always played the role as a consumer (I love shopping!) But what is it like on the other end? Creating the next big trend, watching as people love your product? This is what interests me the most. </P></td>

            <td><h3 style="color: deeppink;">Abilities and work skills:</h3>
                <P><strong>Professional work experience: </strong>This year, I got my first job! As a teaching assistant and grader for a tutoring center, I have learned how to handle myself professionally in workplace settings. I also learned certain work criteria that was new to me: clocking in and out, receiving my first paycheck, and collaborating with my coworkers. 
                   <br> <strong>Dedication:</strong> I am trying public forum debate for the first time this year! Although I have not gained a winning record this year, that has not stopped me from not continuing. I still attend weekly meetings and training to try to improve my performance, instead of being discouraged and quitting. 
                   <br> <strong>Organization:</strong> With multiple advanced classes and extracurricular activities, I have learned that organization is the core skill to staying “on top of it.” I have created an efficient calendar and planning system that allows me to maintain my academic excellence in class while balancing social outgoings, alongside extracurricular tasks. Balance!!

            <td> <h3 style="color: deeppink;">Strengths and personal qualities:</h3>
                <P><strong>Versatile:</strong> I run the social media for two clubs on campus. Through this outreach experience, I have learned how to differentiate content based on the target audience of the club. 
                   <br> <strong>Persistent:</strong>Through 3 APs this year, I have learned that As and 100s aren’t so easy anymore! But I didn’t drop any of my original classes. I decided to stick with it and keep striving for my goal through hard work and dedication. 
                   <br> <strong>Creative:</strong> As a dancer for the Leela Youth Dance Company, expression through movement has always been a part of my life. Throughout the years, I have expanded my dance repertoire to try new styles (risk-taking!) such as Jazz, Bollywood, and Hip-Hop.

        <h2 style="color: deeppink;">Conclusion</h2>
        <P>In the end, I do everything in my power to achieve my dream. Does that mean I go through life on a perfect and smooth linear progression? No! I make mistakes and blunders all the time! But I learn my lesson from them, and gain valuable insight. Thank you for reading my page! I invite you to explore the site at your own leisure. Have a great day! </P>
